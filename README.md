# FeedbackCompiler

A compiler created for the SE2CO11 Compilers module at the University of Reading. This compiler is designed to compile code written in a fictitious language, called Feedback, into C++. The compiler performs simple optimisations and checking for division by zero.

Compiling the compiler requires flex (lex) and bison (yacc) to be installed on your system.

I'm willing to share my project report and documentation to interested parties on a case by case basis. Please email me at rhysaled.streefland@ntlworld.com if you'd like a copy.
